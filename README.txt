Programâ€™s purpose: manage a Ghost database. There are Buildings, and each Building maintains a collection of all Ghosts in the building and all Rooms. Each Room maintains a collection of Ghosts in that room. Each Ghost tracks the Room it is in and uses an enumerated type to track what type of ghost it is, and the likelihood that the ghost is present (a floating-point value between 0.0 and 100.0, but you do not need to validate this)

Files included:  room.c, building.c, ghost.c,  main.c and defs.h and README.txt

Compiling instructions: gcc -o a4 building.c ghost.c main.c room.c

Running instructions: ./a4

How to use program : compile and run program it should print a menu with numbered options to show specifc output.
